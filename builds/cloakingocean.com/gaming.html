                <h2>Gaming Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of my childhood, I've held a controller in my hands! My older brother and sister were avid gamers before me and
                    I followed in their footsteps. I mainly played on Nintendo systems and eventually Xbox 360 games when I was younger. These days,
                    I do most of my gaming on the computer with occasional breaks on other systems.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Early Nintendo</h2>
                <p>
                    My brother has a wide arrangement of classic nintendo consoles such as the NES <i>(Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>,
                    SNES <i>(Super Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube! My favorite game for the NES has to be
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)" target="_blank">Contra</a>! It's a side scroller shooter
                    that also has a small trick you can use to gain 30 lives compared to the 3 lives you start out with! You face an army
                    of opponents while dying if shot only once!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd say my favorite game from the SNES system is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World" target="_blank">Super Mario World</a>! The adventurous theme
                    of this game makes any new player excited to explore! A major part of the game I personally enjoy is the implementation
                    of Yoshi's. Mario can ride on their back and different colored Yoshi's have different unique abilities! For example, the red
                    Yoshi spits fire when it spits something out while the blue Yoshi flies into the air when it has something in it's mouth!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm unsure if I have a specific favorite when it comes to Nintendo 64 games. However, my top favorites are
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie" target="_blank">Banjo Kazooie</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64" target="_blank">Super Mario 64</a>,
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_Legends#Ports" target="_blank">Gauntlet Legends</a>! Banjo Kazooie has an amazing aethetic design along with various different abilities and
                    guns the duo can use! The story line is very compelling as well! Super Mario 64 was a very popular game when it came out
                    due to it's impressive implementation of 3D platforming! Finally, Gauntlet Legends is a game about restoring balance after
                    a massive outbreak of a very dangerous character! You must explore all of the different realms and restore power in each to
                    be able to fight the final boss! It's a 4-player game with a ton of fun mechanics!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once again, it's difficult for me to choose a specific favorite for the Gamecube because it has so many brilliant games!
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion" target="_blank">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin" target="_blank">Pikmin</a> are my top 3 favorites! The Legend of Zelda: The Wind
                    Waker has an amazing cartoonish art style! It's a huge shift from the previous Legend of Zelda games! One major game mechanic
                    of this game is sailing in a boat to get across vast ocean and reach islands sprinkled throughout the entire map! Although that
                    may sound tedious, this game gives you the ability to change direction of the wind! Thus, you can sail anywhere you want with ease!
                    This game also has a ton of puzzles and story! I'd highly recommend playing this game if possible! Luigi's Mansion is a great twist
                    of the classic "Mario saves the day" theme. In this story, Luigi is the one saving Mario! With the help of a genius professor, you are
                    equiped with ghost capturing machines to rid a newly created mansion of all its ghosts! There are also sequels of this game as well
                    that I would recommend as well! And finally, Pikmin is a game all about returning home. When the main character, Olimar, crash lands
                    on a distant plant and all hope seems lost, he discovers small creatues he names Pikmin who eventually help him retrieve his ship parts
                    and return home! It's exciting to build up an army and defeat your foes easily when making use of each pikmin's abilities!

                <h2>Xbox 360</h2>
                <p>
                    With the generally more mature games available on the Xbox 360, it was a hard sell for my father. However, he was eventually convinced
                    and my first games consisted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Pi%C3%B1ata_(video_game)" target="_blank">Viva Piñata</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie:_Nuts_%26_Bolts" target="_blank">Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts</a>! Viva Piñata
                    personally was a let down because its gameplay was nothing like the TV show! It felt more like someone made a game and made it look
                    like Viva Piñata. For Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts, however, I found I enjoyed it much more than the majority. Even though it was a
                    major change in the franchise, it introduced gameplay that was still exciting and entertaining! The whole point of the game is to
                    create vehicles and obtain upgrades to make the best machine for whatever challenge you're facing! It's a very creative game
                    and I enjoyed making my own design of carts, boats, and planes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, a friend introduced me to the game <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Xbox_360_Edition" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>!
                    Instantly, I was hooked! Minecraft is a game about survival and creativity. Most of the world consists of square blocks which can be
                    harvested and collected. It's a very open-ended game because there's no real "end" to the game. Even if you beat the final boss named
                    the "Ender Dragon", you just continue onwards! The player vs. player component was also very exciting! On some days, my friends and I
                    would split up and see who could muster up the most resources and finish off the others! Back in this time, there was no creative mode
                    which allowed people to have infinite building blocks! However, there was a duplication glitch that allowed players to do some crazy things!
                    My friend later showed me the <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/" target="_blank">PC version of Minecraft</a>
                    and I was amazed at all the different creatures and creative mode options! This is what eventually led me to PC gaming!

                <h2>PC Gaming</h2>
                <p>
                    My first gaming computer, a Mac Book Pro, was sold to me by a friend at a very generous price! It was the first time I'd used a Mac computer
                    before! It took quite a long time to get use to. However, the first thing I did on that computer was install Minecraft! My friend and I
                    actually bought each other Minecraft! I was so excited to play around with the in-game commands, additional mobs, and creative mode! Shortly
                    after, my friend and I joined public servers and learned more about the plugins in use in most servers! Like I mentioned on the Java page, this
                    is what led my programming desire to learn more about plugins and create my own! Minecraft has always been one of my favorite games. Although,
                    recently it's become more of a creative space to create plugins than an actual game for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/" target="_blank">League of Legends</a> was another major game my friends and I played! League
                    is a MOBA <i>(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)</i> which consists of 2 teams with 5 people each! Each team has a nexus which if destroyed
                    wins the game for the other team! There's many different mechanics to learn and master. First of all are the wide character or champion pool.
                    Additionally, you'd gain money to buy items that would specifically boost your champion. For me, the learning curve seemed quite steep and
                    I didn't play very seriously. But eventually, after enough time playing and pratice, I really enjoy playing it and improving my skills as well!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steam was always a program I heard about but I knew nothing of at this point. A relative showed me the ropes and all the various games
                    he enjoyed playing. My personal favorites over the years have been <a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/" target="_blank">Garry's Mod</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.superwinthegame.com/" target="_blank">Super Win the Game</a>,
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Souls" target="_blank">Titan Souls</a>! Garry's Mod, similarly to Minecraft, had a very
                    creative aspect to it! There were many custom created characters and items! And there were offcial game modes servers could host. My favorites
                    were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_in_Terrorist_Town" target="_blank">Trouble in Terrorist Town</a> and
                    <a href="https://gmod.fandom.com/wiki/Prop_Hunt" target="_blank">Prop Hunt</a>! Super Win the Game has an amazing retro graphic and mechanic style!
                    It was very nostalgic for me and I'm glad that with modern technology, annoying bugs are much less frequent. It was a nice jump back into time when
                    things felt much more simplier as a kid. And finally Titan Souls is an amazing game! Your character is very small compared the the enormous beasts
                    and monsters you face! This game requires a bit of skill to dodge and land your shots accurately. But the payoff feels amazing! Taking down something
                    10 times your size with a single arrow shot!
