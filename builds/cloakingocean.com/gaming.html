                <h2>Gaming Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of my childhood, I've held a controller in my hands! My older brother and sister were avid gamers before me and
                    I followed in their footsteps. I mainly played on Nintendo systems and eventually Xbox 360 games when I was younger. These days,
                    I do most of my gaming on the computer with occasional breaks on other systems.

                <h2>Early Nintendo</h2>
                <p>
                    My brother has a wide arrangement of classic nintendo consoles such as the NES <i>(Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>,
                    SNES <i>(Super Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube! My favorite game for the NES has to be
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)" target="_blank">Contra</a>! It's a side scroller shooter
                    that also has a small trick you can use to gain 30 lives compared to the 3 lives you start out with! You face an army
                    of opponents while dying if shot only once!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd say my favorite game from the SNES system is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World" target="_blank">Super Mario World</a>! The adventurous theme
                    of this game makes any new player excited to explore! A major part of the game I personally enjoy is the implementation
                    of Yoshi's. Mario can ride on their back and different color Yoshi's have different unique abilities! For example, the red
                    Yoshi spits fire when it spits something out while the blue Yoshi flies into the air when it has something in it's mouth!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm unsure if I have a specific favorite when it comes to Nintendo 64 games. However, my top favorites are
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie" target="_blank">Banjo Kazooie</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64" target="_blank">Super Mario 64</a>,
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_Legends#Ports" target="_blank">Gauntlet Legends</a>! Banjo Kazooie has an amazing aethetic design along with various different abilities and
                    guns the duo can use! The story line is very compelling as well! Super Mario 64 was a very popular game when it came out
                    due to it's impressive implementation of 3D platforming! Finally, Gauntlet Legends is a game about restoring balance after
                    a massive outbreak of a very dangerous character! You must explore all of the different realms and restore power in each to
                    be able to fight the final boss! It's a 4-player game with a ton of fun mechanics!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once again, it's difficult for me to choose a specific favorite for the Gamecube because it has so many brilliant games!
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion" target="_blank">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin" target="_blank">Pikmin</a> are my top 3 favorites! The Legend of Zelda: The Wind
                    Waker has an amazing cartoonish art style! It's a huge shift from the previous Legend of Zelda games! One major game mechanic
                    of this game is sailing in a boat to get across vast ocean and reach islands sprinkled throughout the entire map! Although that
                    may sound tedious, this game gives you the ability to change direction of the wind! Thus, you can sail anywhere you want with ease!
                    This game also has a ton of puzzles and story! I'd highly recommend playing this game if possible! Luigi's Mansion is a great twist
                    of the classic Mario saves the day theme. In this story, Luigi is the one saving Mario! With the help of a genius professor, you are
                    equiped with ghost capturing machines to rid a newly created mansion of all its ghosts! There are also sequels of this game as well
                    that I would recommend as well! And finally, Pikmin is a game all about returning home. When the main character, Olimar, crash lands
                    on a distant plant and all hope seems lost, he discovers small creatues he names Pikmin who eventually help him retrieve his ship parts
                    and return home! It's exciting to build up an army and defeat your foes easily when making use of each pikmin's abilities!

                <p>
                    With the generally more mature games available on the Xbox 360, it was a hard sell for my father. However, he was eventually convinced
                    and my first games consisted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Pi%C3%B1ata_(video_game)" target="_blank">Viva Pi√±ata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie:_Nuts_%26_Bolts" target="_blank">Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts</a>
