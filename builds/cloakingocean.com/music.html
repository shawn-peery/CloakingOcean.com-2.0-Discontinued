                <h2>Music Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Since about 5th grade, I've been able to play the piano! I've practiced on and off throughout a couple of years!
                    With the help of my school and my grandmother, I've been able to improve my piano skills quite drastically from when I first
                    started. However, even before learning to play the piano, music was a huge part of my life! I listen to music almost any
                    chance I get!
                </p>

                <h2>Learning the Piano</h2>
                <p>
                    My first piano experience started with my grandmother. She taught me very simple and short songs at the beginning like mary
                    had a little lamb. I began to feel like I was cheating learning because instead of translating notes into their letters
                    and then finding the key corresponding to that letter, I would just look at how many keys away a note was and just play
                    it that way. I thought I would never be able to improve my skills with the piano because of that. However, my father and grandmother continued
                    to push me and encourage me. Eventually, I found that I was actually playing the notes correctly rather than my previous method!
                </p>

                <p>
                    My grandmother taught me mainly classical music and hymns. I learned to play songs from Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and more! It
                    was quite exciting to learn how to perform such classics from the beginning! Attending a piano class after school, I also learned
                    many lullabies and modern songs! Having this mix of genres made it exciting to play and learn more! Recently, I've continued
                    to learn hymns as well as learning many popular pop songs!

                <h2>Music I Enjoy</h2>
                <p>
                    Being a religious person, I've always loved hymns and songs similar to them! I also found myself being quite content with many
                    different genres. My mood dictates what style I desire. One of my favorite bands, when I was younger, was The Black Eyed
                    Peas. Over the years I've highly enjoyed songs from Panic at the Disco, Secondhand Serenade, Maroon 5, Paramore, Echosmith,
                    Coldplay and more! The genres I don't enjoy as much are rap and screamo music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recently I've also enjoyed many electronic songs from TheFatRat and Alan Walker! I've started enjoying the Dubstep and EDM genres
                    more and more as I've explored their music. I also really enjoy chill genres like Cavetown and Khai Dreams. Music is a huge part
                    of my life!
