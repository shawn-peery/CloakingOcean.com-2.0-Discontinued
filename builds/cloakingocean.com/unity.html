                <h2>Spy Hop Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I first heard of <a href="https://spyhop.org/">Spy Hop</a> when I was in elementary school from an after school teacher who had noticed
                    my computer skills. However, the courses she informed me about were too expensive to join at that time. Fast forward to my high school
                    years and once again I was recommended to participate in Spy Hop, this time by my programming teacher. After learning more about their
                    <a href="https://spyhop.org/apprenticeship-program/">Apprenticeship Programs</a>, I immediately sent in an application!

                <h2>Winter 2014 Session</h2>
                <p>
                    The winter season of 2014 was my first experience working with Spy Hop. My initial goals were quite ambitious for a novice programmer and
                    I quickly learned game development takes much more time and effort than I realized. Either way, I was excited to finally get some experience
                    creating games with an actual team! I was soon introduced to the game engine, <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity">Unity</a>, which Spy Hop uses for their design apprenticeship programs.
                </p><!-- First experience with Spy Hop -->

                <p>
                    Unity's interface and scripting format were quite different from what I was used to. C#, Javascript, and Boo were the only available programming langauges.
                    I noticed Javascript's similar name to Java and assumed it would be relatively the same. However, C#'s syntax is more similar to Java than JavaScript!
                    This was quite an interesting find! Anyways, I continued with Javascript because of it's relatively looser syntax rules. After many tutorials and help from
                    the Spy Hop design team I quickly understood how Unity functions. There were still many features of the engine I had yet to learn, but it was enough to start
                    contributing to the project.
                </p><!-- Learning Unity -->

                <p>
                    The concept of the first game I participated in was an endless scroller that taught the player which foods are beneficial and which foods are unhealthy. Because Spy Hop
                    is supported by community contributions, the games it produces have an educational aspect. Initially we started off with a package from the
                    <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/">Unity Asset Store</a> which was very polished. This is a common practice to use available assets to focus the team's time
                    on different parts of the project. Unfortunately, it was coded in C#, which was not widely known to our development team, and the complexity and relationships of the
                    package made it very hard to edit single scripts without affecting the whole package. Because of this, we decided to start from scratch and create all of the game's components
                    ourselves. Having a demonstration of the game would've been a great addition to this section of my website. Although, I was unable to find the original files of the project we worked on.
                    If I happen to find them in the future, I'll update this page!

                <h2>Fall 2014 Session</h2>
                <p>
                    The next season I participated in was the fall season of 2014. For this project we decided to create a 2D exploration game which teaches the player how anti-bodies in our bodies
                    work. Similar to the first game we created, we started off with a package from the asset store known as <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/ferr2d-terrain-tool-11653">Ferr2D</a>. This package included all the fluid movement and collision of the main character along
                    with many different available terrains. We had much more success editing this package to our needs. The player is able to transform into different anti-bodies at will. In order to
                    progress and defeat all enemies in the player's path, they must change into the anti-body that can absorb the threat. Attempting to absorb an enemy while being the wrong anti-body results in damage to the player.
                    I designed and implemented the GUI <i>(Graphical User Interface)</i> that allows the player to switch between anti-bodies. Once again, I don't have the original files to create a demonstration of the project but I will update this
                    page if found in the future.

                <h2>Fall 2016 Session</h2>
                <p>
                    The fall 2016 season was my last session with Spy Hop. During this one, instead of the apprenticeship consisting of just game development, we instead we learned about many different design programs available to us! I believe 2/3's of the
                    apprenticeship was various design programs and the last 1/3 was game design. It was very intriguing and adventerous to explore all of design options. We learned the difference betwen vector graphics and raster graphics as well as which programs
                    use which type. We were also introduced to 3D Modeling as well as 2D animation! Honestly, this part of the intership was a ton of fun! The programs we were taking a look into I rarely used before!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, when the game design portion of the internship came I was extremely excited! In this session, I was the Head Developer! This means I was somewhat showing the other developers the ropes, much like how previous Head Developers helped me
                    understand Unity! During our brainstorm session, we decided we wanted the game to teach important U.S. historical events! We quickly decided which events we wanted to showcase as well as the idea of an exploration educational game. Initially, the player
                    has been stranded in a different time. In order to get back, they need to explore the different themed areas to collect key items from each event. Additionally, the player needs to retrieve these items in chronological order! There are scattered information
                    posters in each area to give a hint to the time of each event. Once you've collected all of the items in order, you are able to access the time machine and return to your time! I was very impressed by the speed of the team given our smaller time window!
                    The major parts of the project I worked on were the map layout as well as combining all of the artwork and scripts together! I also threw in some control tutorial animations throughout the map to help the player understand how the controls work! Below is
                    a small sample of the Boston Tea Party area! You can download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ux07V-mTiJdyO_h8Wwd0B_VtnLR_P2wm/view" target="_blank">History Mystery</a> here!
