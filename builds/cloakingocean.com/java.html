                <h1>Java | My First Progrmaming Language!</h1>
            </div>
            <section>
                <p>
                    I've been programming with Java for around five to six years. It was the very first programming language I was
                    introduced to. The spark that lead me to further my knowledge was Minecraft and a server API <i>(Application Programming Interface)</i> named Bukkit.
                    At this point I had just recently started playing Minecraft on my computer rather than my xbox and I was excited to see
                    the vastly larger range of options that were available to me! Later on once I learned of Minecraft server
                    mods, my mind was blown and I <i>had</i> to learn how these were made!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started watching youtube tutorials about programming with Bukkit.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrMGokrBHdg&list=PL4A0C6138F3F5AA41"> TheBCBroz</a> was my very first programming
                    teacher. I quickly learned Bukkit was only a small part of a gigantic programming language known as Java. In order to
                    be successful in this endeavour, I needed to learn Java's core as well as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lead me to TheNewBoston's Java tutorials and eventually enrolling in Java programming classes at my high school. That's
                    where I learned many important programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, execution time, and boolean logic.
                    I experimented by creating a handful of desktop applications using spring and other API. To this day Java is my strongest programming language.
                    However, Java development has been put to the backburner recently because I've been trying to increase my understanding of
                    other languages. Below is one of my very first and very rough projects. I was attempting to make a space invader game.

            <h2>Minecraft (Bukkit/Spigot)</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, Minecraft was my starting drive to learn programming in general. The server API was exciting, new, and vast.
                    Instantly, I jumped onto the <a href="https://bukkit.org/forums/"> Bukkit Forums</a> to find anyone willing to let me experiment
                    plugin development on their server. For a few years I worked on personal and small client projects to experiment with the API and
                    gain experience in the process. What follows is a look into one of my favorite personal projects.

            <h2>Whewho ~ Advanced Modular Teleportation</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    The above animation demonstrates my teleportation plugin, Whewheo! It features advanced teleportation and modular particle
                    generator design. Players can easily use the warp compass to get from point A to point B. The items you see on screen are all
                    customizable as well as the particle generator used for sending or receiving animations. Whewho's aethetic teleportation
                    system has been designed from the beginning to be easily added upon to enable more diverse options! I believe this project
                    was originally requested by an individual who wanted it to be available for everyone. This is one of my most challenge projects
                    and one that I'm very proud of! However, I do plan to improve upon many things in the future.
