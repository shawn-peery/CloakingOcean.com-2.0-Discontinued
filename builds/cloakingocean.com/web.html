                <h2>Web Development Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Similarly to my Java education, I learned much from
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp0f0zTPLec&list=PL081AC329706B2953" target="_blank">TheNewBoston</a>! From these
                    tutorials, I've learned that basically HTML is the core content, CSS is the styling and layout of the content, and JavaScript
                    allows your website to be smart and interactive. These are the three major components that make a modern webpage

                <h2>TheNewBoston Tutorial Project (Exitium)</h2>
                <p>
                    As you'll see in the upcoming examples, my usage of JavaScript is scare in the earlier days of my education. This first
                    website was a result of following TheNewBoston's web development tutorial. At this point in time I had a relatively strong
                    knowledge of HTML and was learning the different options of CSS. This was the first time I was able to make a sidebar using
                    CSS! I've uploaded the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=14dFUtIx67lfLYtP1F7ZmmBviN4Zqgen3" target="_blank">Website's Files</a> as well.

                <h2>Exitium.org</h2>
                <p>
                    Exitium.org was a small passion project I was creating for my friends. It was a chance to actually create something with the
                    skills I've aquired as well as a lot of fun! Exitium was the name our group when we were younger. As you will also
                    see, I experimented with embedding games from other websites offering html code into my own page. I was planning to have a game
                    showcase every week! You can see the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HffFgEwkmTAW2FOcHiPFKyMfzYtTs4JZ" target="_blank">Website Files</a> by clicking the link!

                <h2>Cloaking_Ocean.com (Old)</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the previous rendition of my portfolio website! You can get the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XrSP2rn2KCj6JumjmEzufjBhtu0B8bnq" target="_blank">Website Files</a> from clicking the link! A major change I've made from this previous version is including the
                    JavaScript framework, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. Bootstrap is a JavaScript framework
                    that comes included with many CSS and JavaScript components that are incredibly polished and increase a programmer's efficiency
                    greatly! These libraries and frameworks are vast and varied in the web development world and I'm just scraping the surface!
                    Also, the color scheme between versions has also been greatly improved in my eyes! When this project is finished, I'll
                    add a GitLab link here for the new website.
