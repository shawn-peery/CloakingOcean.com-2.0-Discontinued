# About This Project
This portfolio website integrates my (at that time) newly developed knowledge with [Bootstrap] with a brand new design and color theme! I additionally added more content to each topic compared to my [previous portfolio project]. Using Bootstrap, my 
design choices were transformed into a sleeker and polished product. I really enjoyed learning about Bootstrap and what layouts are possible with it!

# Topics

## Java
I've known Java and the Bukkit API since 2012! I mainly use Java to create Minecraft server
mods!

## Unity
First introduced to me during my initial Spy Hop session, Unity has become a game engine favorite
of mine! It's incredible how much it offers while still having a completely free version!

## Web
Step by step, I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve on my previous website designs!

## Gaming
Being my favorite pastime, gaming is something I started from a very young age. I've continued
to increase my skills and understanding in this aspect as well!

## Music
With a majority of my life being filled with music, I've learned how to perform music myself by playing the piano!
