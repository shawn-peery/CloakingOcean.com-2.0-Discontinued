# CloakingOcean.com
CloakingOcean.com is a personal, custom coded portfolio I made for myself, Shawn Whitaker!
It showcases many different aspects of my life.

## Java
I've known Java and the Bukkit API since 2012! I mainly use Java to create Minecraft server
mods!

## Unity
First introduced to me during my initial Spy Hop session, Unity has become a game engine favorite
of mine! It's incredible how much it offers while still having a completely free version!

## Web
Step by step, I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve on my previous website designs!

## Gaming
Being my favorite pastime, gaming is something I started from a very young age. I've continued
to increase my skills and understanding in this aspect as well!

## Music
With a majority of my life being filled with music, I learn how to perform music using the piano!
